-----

add all the additional is_extra metrics like has_warnings!!!
    presently I just blindly skip is_extra, is_experimental. need a way to put
    those back in.

vincent claims this is needed to avoid dying mid-way through tests.. fix.

need to test this without perlbrew

we can compile our own perl and install it into ~ether/bin/perl202
and install all the prereqs we need...

-----------

- new interface, to allow for a hashref of options
    e.g.:
    {
      todo => 1,
      type => [ qw(is_extra is_experimental) ],
        or:
      tests => [ ... test names ],
    }

  when calling _run_indicator, set local $TODO if this metric is marked as non-failing.

    *** and allow is_extra tests in [Test::Kwalitee]


- update metric documentation for latest MCA



investigate this failure:

and see #perl-qa scrollback about vincent's complaint
14:59 -!- vincent claims this is needed or kwalitee will die - investigate and fix.

-----------

do not run tests (and bail out noisily) if running when a cpan client is
installing:  e.g. see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=107821


-------

respect x_cpants metadata by skipping the listed metrics -- where is the spec for it?
